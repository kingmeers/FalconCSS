## Open Source CSS Framework

Always wanted to create a CSS Framework after seeing the things others lacked.
Maybe this will be a complete failure, but it will be fun.

### List of things I plan to implement (so far):
* Grid System
    * xs
    * md
    * lg
    * hidden
    * Offset
* Buttons
    * Huge variety of colours
    * Customisable
    * Various states
* Better Typography
    * Headings
    * Inline text elements
    * Lists
    * Blockquote
* Contextual Elements
* Helper classes
    * Alignment classes
    * Transformation classes
    * Box shadows
    * Classes for:
        * width and height
        * margin and padding
* Semantic AF
    * Write class as if it were CSS

### Will start documentation soon (but till then please explore!)
